# Test Scene Controls

To move the camera, use the **`WASD`** keys.

The `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` keys serve as modifiers, and change what the `WASD` (and arrow) keys control.

## While holding the `UP` key: *Light Position*

`WASD`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` now control the position of the light source in the test scene.

## While holding the `DOWN` key: *Colour Adjustment*

`W`: Increase the `red`ness of all models

`S`: Decrease the `red`ness of all models

`D`: Increase the `green`ness of all models

`S`: Decrease the `green`ness of all models

`RIGHT`: Increase the `blue`ness of all models

`LEFT`: Decrease the `blue`ness of all models

## While holding the `LEFT` key: *Brightness Adjustment*

`W`: Increase material colour brightness of all models

`S`: Decrease material colour brightness of all models

`D`: Increase material shininess of all models

`A`: Decrease material shininess of all models
