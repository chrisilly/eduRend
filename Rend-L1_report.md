# 1. Cube

To make the `Cube` class, I started by copying the `QuadModel` class verbatim, only renaming `quad` to `cube`. I added respective lines in the `scene` for our new "`Cube`" and then added lines to render it the same way the `QuadModel` does. After commenting out `m_quad->Render()`, there was still a cube (quad) rendering on screen. Success!

# 2. Camera Control

# 3. Hierarchical transformations

<!-- # 4. OBJ-export & Import -->
